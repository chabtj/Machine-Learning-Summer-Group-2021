Pandas, whose name is derived from 'panel data,' is an open-source software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. This is probably the most important topic of the three introductory ones, which you'll be using a lot when handling real-world data.

This time you will be handling CSV data files in both Theory and Exercise.
- If you are using Anaconda, make sure your notebook and CSV file is in the same folder.
- If you are using Colab, you need to upload the CSV file first to the notebook. To do this follow the steps in this video: https://youtu.be/oqMImCeXi6o . The required code (shown in the video) is already written and commented in the first few cells of the notebook. Colab users uncomment the cells, make necessary changes (inserting file ID), and run those cells.

Pandas is a vast topic and difficult in the beginning for everyone. So don't get discouraged if there is something that you don't understand.
